\section{About me}

Born on December 26, 1996 in Bucaramanga, Colombia, I've always been characterized by my strong passions. My first discoveries on symmetry through music laid the basis for my passion to understand what surrounds us. Physics has offered me a path through which I can explore the world making use of my creativity. At this point in my life I've decided to take advantage of every chance I get along the way to learn new things, meet new people, and become a better person. I am certain that the success of this enterprise will be guaranteed by the discipline and commitment I give to my work.
