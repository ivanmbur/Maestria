Give a brief description of your interest in participating in the School and Conference on Noncommutative Geometry, School and Conference Noncommutative Geometry and Poisson Geometry 2018: From a broad perspective my research interests are centered around the rigorous description of quantum field theories. Noncommutative geometry promises to play an important and deep role in this endeavor. The topics of quantum gravity, interacting quantum fields, geometric quantization, topological phase transitions, thermal states, and many more, all seem to be susceptible to analysis through noncommutative geometry. This is the reason why I want to be a part of this school. This is an important opportunity to learn from some of the most important mathematicians in the field some of the aspects of this challenging theory.

On the other hand, physics has and will keep bringing forth new ideas and developments to noncommutative geometry. I hope my experience in physics can be of use to the discussions that will certainly appear during the duration of the school. With certainty my commitment to the lectures and mini courses will help me eventually become an active researcher in this beautiful mathematical field.

Finally, I believe this is an important opportunity to network at a national and international level. As a young researcher, these events are an important opportunity to meet future colleagues and plant the seeds for collaborations. The particular prestige of this event, as evidenced by the lecturers and the scientific and organizing committees, is bound to be the birthplace of new and exciting ideas. It would be an amazing opportunity to be part of that.
