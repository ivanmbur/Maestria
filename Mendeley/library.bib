@article{Balachandran2013c,
abstract = {In a quantum system, there may be many density matrices associated with a state on an algebra of observables. For each density matrix, one can compute its entropy. These are in general different. Therefore one reaches the remarkable possibility that there may be many entropies for a given state [Private communication from R. Sorkin]. This ambiguity in entropy can often be traced to a gauge symmetry emergent from the non-trivial topological character of the configuration space of the underlying system. It can also happen in finite-dimensional matrix models. In the present work, we discuss this entropy ambiguity and its consequences for an ethylene molecule. This is a very simple and well-known system where these notions can be put to tests. Besides its intrinsic conceptual interest, the simplicity of this model can serve as an introduction to a similar discussion of systems such as coloured monopoles and the breaking of colour symmetry.},

@article{Borchers2000,
abstract = {In the book of Haag [Local Quantum Physics (Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1992)] about local quantum field theory the main results are obtained by the older methods of C * - and W * -algebra theory. A great advance, especially in the theory of W * -algebras, is due to Tomita's discovery of the theory of modular Hilbert algebras [Quasi-standard von Neumann algebras, Preprint (1967)]. Because of the abstract nature of the underlying concepts, this theory became (except for some sporadic results) a technique for quantum field theory only in the beginning of the nineties. In this review the results obtained up to this point will be collected and some problems for the future will be discussed at the end. In the first section the technical tools will be presented. Then in the second section two concepts, the half-sided translations and the half-sided modular inclusions, will be explained. These concepts have revolutionized the handling of quantum field theory. Examples for which the modular groups are explicitly known are presented in the third section. One of the important results of the new theory is the proof of the PCT theorem in the theory of local observables. Questions connected with the proof are discussed in Sec. IV. Section V deals with the structure of local algebras and with questions connected with symmetry groups. In Sec. VI a theory of tensor product decompositions will be presented. In the last section problems that are closely connected with the modular theory and that should be treated in the future will be discussed.},

abstract = {It has been known for some years that entanglement entropy obtained from partial trace does not provide the correct entanglement measure when applied to systems of identical particles. Several criteria have been proposed that have the drawback of being different according to whether one is dealing with fermions, bosons, or distinguishable particles. In this Letter, we give a precise and mathematically natural answer to this problem. Our approach is based on the use of the more general idea of the restriction of states to subalgebras. It leads to a novel approach to entanglement, which is suitable to be used in general quantum systems and especially in systems of identical particles. This settles some recent controversy regarding entanglement for identical particles. The prospects for applications of our criteria are wide ranging, from spin chains in condensed matter to entropy of black holes.},

abstract = {The von Neumann entropy of a generic quantum state is not unique unless the state can be uniquely decomposed as a sum of extremal or pure states. As pointed out to us by Sorkin, this happens if the GNS representation (of the algebra of observables in some quantum state) is reducible, and some representations in the decomposition occur with non-trivial degeneracy. This non-unique entropy can occur at zero temperature. We will argue elsewhere in detail that the degeneracies in the GNS representation can be interpreted as an emergent broken gauge symmetry, and play an important role in the analysis of emergent entropy due to non-Abelian anomalies. Finally, we establish the analogue of an H-theorem for this entropy by showing that its evolution is Markovian, determined by a stochastic matrix.},

abstract = {We present a general approach to quantum entanglement and entropy that is based on algebras of observables and states thereon. In contrast to more standard treatments, Hilbert space is an emergent concept, appearing as a representation space of the observable algebra, once a state is chosen. In this approach, which is based on the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal construction, the study of subsystems becomes particularly clear. We explicitly show how the problems associated with the partial trace for the study of entanglement of identical particles are readily overcome. In particular, a suitable entanglement measure is proposed that can be applied to systems of particles obeying Fermi, Bose, para-, and even braid-group statistics. The generality of the method is also illustrated by study of the time evolution of subsystems emerging from restriction to subalgebras. Problems related to anomalies and quantum epistemology are also discussed. DOI:},

The quantum network can be trained efficiently using gradient descent on a cost function to perform quantum generalisations of classical tasks. We demonstrate numerically that it can: (i) compress quantum states onto a minimal number of qubits, creating a quantum autoencoder, and (ii) discover quantum communication protocols such as teleportation. Our general recipe is theoretical and implementation-independent. The quantum neuron module can naturally be implemented photonically.},

abstract = {Quantum indistinguishability plays a crucial role in many low-energy physical phenomena, from quantum fluids to molecular spectroscopy. It is, however, typically ignored in most high temperature processes, particularly for ionic coordinates, implicitly assumed to be distinguishable, incoherent and thus well-approximated classically. We explore chemical reactions involving small symmetric molecules, and argue that in many situations a full quantum treatment of collective nuclear degrees of freedom is essential. Supported by several physical arguments, we conjecture a "Quantum Dynamical Selection" (QDS) rule for small symmetric molecules that precludes chemical processes that involve direct transitions from orbitally non-symmetric molecular states. As we propose and discuss, the implications of the Quantum Dynamical Selection rule include: (i) a differential chemical reactivity of para- and ortho-hydrogen, (ii) a mechanism for inducing inter-molecular quantum entanglement of nuclear spins, (iii) a new isotope fractionation mechanism, (iv) a novel explanation of the enhanced chemical activity of "Reactive Oxygen Species", (v) illuminating the importance of ortho-water molecules in modulating the quantum dynamics of liquid water, (vi) providing the critical quantum-to-biochemical linkage in the nuclear spin model of the (putative) quantum brain, among others.},

abstract = {One of von Neumann's motivations for developing the theory of operator algebras and his and Murray's 1936 classification of factors was the question of possible decompositions of quantum systems into independent parts. For quantum systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom the simplest possibility, i.e., factors of type I in the terminology of Murray and von Neumann, are perfectly adequate. In relativistic quantum field theory (RQFT), on the other hand, factors of type III occur naturally. The same holds true in quantum statistical mechanics of infinite systems. In this brief review some physical consequences of the type III property of the von Neumann algebras corresponding to localized observables in RQFT and their difference from the type I case will be discussed. The cumulative effort of many people over more than 30 years has established a remarkable uniqueness result: The local algebras in RQFT are generically isomorphic to the unique, hyperfinite type {\$}{\{}\backslashrm III{\}}{\_}{\{}1{\}}{\$} factor in Connes' classification of 1973. Specific theories are characterized by the net structure of the collection of these isomorphic algebras for different space-time regions, i.e., the way they are embedded into each other.},

abstract = {We show that perfect quantum teleportation can be achieved with mixed photon polarization states when nonlocal memory effects influence the dynamics of the quantum system. The protocol is carried out with a pair of photons, whose initial maximally entangled state is destroyed by local decoherence prior to teleportation. It is demonstrated that the presence of strong nonlocal memory effects, which arise from initial correlations between the environments of the photons, allow to restore perfect teleportation. We further analyze how the amount of initial correlations within the environment affects the fidelity of the protocol, and find that for a moderate amount of correlations the fidelity exceeds the one of the previously known optimal teleportation protocol without memory effects. Our results show that memory effects can be exploited in harnessing noisy quantum systems for quantum communication and that non-Markovianity is a resource for quantum information tasks.},

abstract = {This text presents a graduate-level introduction to differential geometry for mathematics and physics students. The exposition follows the historical development of the concepts of connection and curvature with the goal of explaining the Chern-Weil theory of characteristic classes on a principal bundle. Along the way we encounter some of the high points in the history of differential geometry, for example, Gauss' Theorema Egregium and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Exercises throughout the book test the reader's understanding of the material and sometimes illustrate extensions of the theory. Initially, the prerequisites for the reader include a passing familiarity with manifolds. After the first chapter, it becomes necessary to understand and manipulate differential forms. A knowledge of de Rham cohomology is required for the last third of the text. Prerequisite material is contained in author's text An Introduction to Manifolds, and can be learned in one semester. For the benefit of the reader and to establish common notations, Appendix A recalls the basics of manifold theory. Additionally, in an attempt to make the exposition more self-contained, sections on algebraic constructions such as the tensor product and the exterior power are included. Differential geometry, as its name implies, is the study of geometry using differential calculus. It dates back to Newton and Leibniz in the seventeenth century, but it was not until the nineteenth century, with the work of Gauss on surfaces and Riemann on the curvature tensor, that differential geometry flourished and its modern foundation was laid. Over the past one hundred years, differential geometry has proven indispensable to an understanding of the physical world, in Einstein's general theory of relativity, in the theory of gravitation, in gauge theory, and now in string theory. Differential geometry is also useful in topology, several complex variables, algebraic geometry, complex manifolds, and dynamical systems, among other fields. The field has even found applications to group theory as in Gromov's work and to probability theory as in Diaconis's work. It is not too far-fetched to argue that differential geometry should be in every mathematician's arsenal. Preface -- Chapter 1. Curvature and Vector Fields -- 1. Riemannian Manifolds -- 2.

Its statistical mechanics is studied by using the covariant statistical theory. A simple statistical state that represents the cosmic background radiation is constructed. The properties of this state support the general theory; in particular, the idea that a preferred time variable, denoted thermodynamical time, is singled out by the statistical state can be tested within this model. The thermodynamical time is computed and shown to agree with the standard Robertson-Walker time. In addition, an application of the general theory to a simple special relativistic system, and a proposal for an application to full general relativity are also presented.

abstract = {These lectures are intended as an introduction to the technique of path integrals and their applications in physics. The audience is mainly first-year graduate students, and it is assumed that the reader has a good foundation in quantum mechanics. No prior exposure to path integrals is assumed, however. The path integral is a formulation of quantum mechanics equivalent to the standard formulations, offering a new way of looking at the subject which is, arguably, more intuitive than the usual approaches. Applications of path integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. After an introduction including a very brief historical overview of the subject, we derive a path integral expression for the propagator in quantum mechanics, including the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. We then discuss a variety of applications, including path integrals in multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics, perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and instantons via path integrals. For the most part, the emphasis is on explicit calculations in the familiar setting of quantum mechanics, with some discussion (often brief and schematic) of how these ideas can be applied to more complicated situations such as field theory.},

@article{Data2016,
abstract = {This talk reviews the constraints imposed by binary-pulsar data on gravity theories, focusing on ``tensor-scalar'' ones which are the best motivated alternatives to general relativity. We recall that binary-pulsar tests are qualitatively different from solar-system experiments, because of nonperturbative strong-field effects which can occur in compact objects like neutron stars, and because one can observe the effect of gravitational radiation damping. Some theories which are strictly indistinguishable from general relativity in the solar system are ruled out by binary-pulsar observations. During the last months, several impressive new experimental data have been published. Today, the most constraining binary pulsar is no longer the celebrated (Hulse-Taylor) PSR B1913+16, but the neutron star-white dwarf system PSR J1141-6545. In particular, in a region of the ``theory space'', solar-system tests were known to give the tightest constraints; PSR J1141-6545 is now almost as powerful. We also comment on the possible scalar-field effects for the detection of gravitational waves with future interferometers. The presence of a scalar partner to the graviton might be detectable with the LISA space experiment, but we already know that it would have a negligible effect for LIGO and VIRGO, so that the general relativistic wave templates can be used securely for these ground interferometers.},

The key idea in controlled teleportation is that the teleportation is performed only with the participation of the controller. We calculate a quantitative measure of the controller's power and establish a lower bound on the control power required for controlled teleportation. We show that the maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state is a suitable channel for controlled teleportation of arbitrary single qubits-the controller's power meets the bound and the teleportation fidelity without the controller's permission is no better than the fidelity of a classical channel. We also construct partially entangled channels that exceed the bound for controlled teleportation of a restricted set of states called the equatorial states. We calculate the minimum entanglement required in these channels to exceed the bound. Moreover, we find that in these restricted controlled teleportation schemes, the partially entangled channels can outperform maximally entangled channels with respect to the controller's power. Our results provide an alternative perspective on controlled teleportation schemes and are of practical interest since we propose useful partially entangled channels.},

abstract = {We discuss the emergence of time in quantum gravity, and ask whether time is always "something that flows"'. We first recall that this is indeed the case in both relativity and quantum mechanics, although in very different manners: time flows geometrically in relativity (i.e. as a flow of proper time in the four dimensional space-time), time flows abstractly in quantum mechanics (i.e. as a flow in the space of observables of the system). We then ask the same question in quantum gravity, in the light of the thermal time hypothesis of Connes and Rovelli. The latter proposes to answer the question of time in quantum gravity (or at least one of its many aspects), by postulating that time is a state dependent notion. This means that one is able to make a notion of time-as-an-abstract-flow - that we call the thermal time - emerge from the knowledge of both: 1) the algebra of observables of the physical system under investigation, 2) a state of thermal equilibrium of this system. Formally, this thermal time is similar to the abstract flow of time in quantum mechanics, but we show in various examples that it may have a concrete implementation either as a geometrical flow, or as a geometrical flow combined with a non-geometric action. This indicates that in quantum gravity, time may well still be "something that flows" at some abstract algebraic level, but this does not necessarily imply that time is always and only "something that flows" at the geometric level.},

abstract = {We present a general approach to quantum entanglement and entropy that is based on algebras of observables and states thereon. In contrast to more standard treatments, Hilbert space is an emergent concept, appearing as a representation space of the observable algebra, once a state is chosen. In this approach, which is based on the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal construction, the study of subsystems becomes particularly clear. We explicitly show how the problems associated with the partial trace for the study of entanglement of identical particles are readily overcome. In particular, a suitable entanglement measure is proposed that can be applied to systems of particles obeying Fermi, Bose, para-, and even braid-group statistics. The generality of the method is also illustrated by study of the time evolution of subsystems emerging from restriction to subalgebras. Problems related to anomalies and quantum epistemology are also discussed. DOI:},

abstract = {By the birth of Quantum Physics, many new areas were opened for research and development in the world of science and technology. One such field is Quantum Computing and Communication where there is room for all that was once a dream in the field of computing and communication. Ultra high speed, immunity to eavesdropping, security, and name it and it may be possible. This paper gives a brief review of what is happening in the field of quantum computing and communication. We try to give an idea on polarization, quantum entanglement and their use in quantum communication and also briefly explain quantum communication networks, teleportation over optic fiber cables, quantum cryptography, quantum based satellite communication and quantum memory.},

By using a quantum jump approach, we demonstrate that in the presence of quantum coherent energy transfer and energetic disorder, the efficiency of excitation transfer from the antenna to the reaction center depends intimately on the quantum superposition properties of the initial state. In particular, we find that efficiency is sensitive to symmetric and asymmetric superposition of states in the basis of localized excitations, indicating that initial-state properties can be used as an efficiency control parameter at low temperatures.},

The capability of controlling our channel allows us to visualize its effects in a quantum system. Differently from standard dephasing channels, our channel presents an exotic behavior in the sense that the evolution of a state, from a pure to a mixed state, shows an oscillatory behavior if tracked in the Bloch sphere. Additionally, we report the evolution of the purity and perform a quantum process tomography to obtain the $\backslash$chi matrix associated to our channel.},

Several criteria have been proposed that have the drawback of being different according to whether one is dealing with fermions, bosons, or distinguishable particles. In this Letter, we give a precise and mathematically natural answer to this problem. Our approach is based on the use of the more general idea of the restriction of states to subalgebras. It leads to a novel approach to entanglement, which is suitable to be used in general quantum systems and especially in systems of identical particles. This settles some recent controversy regarding entanglement for identical particles. The prospects for applications of our criteria are wide ranging, from spin chains in condensed matter to entropy of black holes.},

abstract = {For a quantum field in a thermal equilibrium state we discuss the group generated by time translations and the modular action associated with an algebra invariant under half-sided translations. The modular flows associated with the algebras of the forward light cone and a space-like wedge admit a simple geometric description in two dimensional models that factorize in light-cone coordinates. At large distances from the domain boundary compared to the inverse temperature the flow pattern is essentially the same as time translations, whereas the zero temperature results are approximately reproduced close to the edge of the wedge and the apex of the cone. Associated with each domain there is also a one parameter group with a positive generator, for which the thermal state is a ground state. Formally, this may be regarded as a certain converse of the Unruh-effect.},

Some operator theory and a first exposure to von Neu-mann algebras After introducing concrete and abstract von Neumann alge-bras, we give a crash course on the two pillars of operator theory in Hilbert space: the spectral theorem and the polar decomposition theorem. And we finish with some basic von Neumann algebra theory. 3. Normality We discuss some of the equivalent descriptions of what it takes to belong to the pre-dual of a von Neumann algebra, as well as demonstrate the equivalence of the concrete and abstract descriptions of a von Neumann algebra. 4. The standard form of von Neumann algebras We discuss what may be considered the analogue in von Neu-mann algebra theory of the existence and uniquenes of Haar measure in the theory of locally compact groups. 5. The Tomita-Takesaki Theorem We discuss: states and weights, the GNS construction for weights, the Tomita-Takesaki theorem, modular automorphism groups, Connes' unitary cocycle theorem, ... 6.

abstract = {In a quantum system, there may be many density matrices associated with a state on an algebra of observables. For each density matrix, one can compute its entropy. These are in general different. Therefore one reaches the remarkable possibility that there may be many entropies for a given state [Private communication from R. Sorkin]. This ambiguity in entropy can often be traced to a gauge symmetry emergent from the non-trivial topological character of the configuration space of the underlying system. It can also happen in finite-dimensional matrix models. In the present work, we discuss this entropy ambiguity and its consequences for an ethylene molecule. This is a very simple and well-known system where these notions can be put to tests. Besides its intrinsic conceptual interest, the simplicity of this model can serve as an introduction to a similar discussion of systems such as coloured monopoles and the breaking of colour symmetry.},

The system can be, for instance, the polarization of a photon, which forms part of a polarization-entangled two-photon state, or the spatial shape of a coherent beam, where each spatial mode bears different polarizations. Whereas a local unitary transformation of the system does not affect its coherence, global unitary transformations modifying both the system and its surroundings can enhance its coherence, transforming mutual correlations into coherence. The question naturally arises of what is the best measure that quantifies the correlations that can be turned into coherence, and how much coherence can be extracted. We answer both questions, and illustrate its application for some typical simple systems, with the aim at illuminating the general concept of enhancing coherence by modifying correlations.},

abstract = {A general quantum field theory is considered in which the fields are assumed to be operator‐valued tempered distributions. The system of fields may include any number of boson fields and fermion fields. A theorem which relates certain complex Lorentz transformations to the T C P transformation is stated and proved. With reference to this theorem, duality conditions are considered, and it is shown that such conditions hold under various physically reasonable assumptions about the fields. Extensions of the algebras of field operators are discussed with reference to the duality conditions. Local internal symmetries are discussed, and it is shown that these commute with the Poincar{\'{e}} group and with the T C P transformation.},

abstract = {The mathematical language of modern quantum mechanics is operator theory. Operators play there a role similar to functions in classical me- chanics, probability theory and statistics. However, while the use of func- tions in classical theories is founded on premises which seem intuitively quite clear, in quantum theory the situation with operators is different. Historically the “matrix mechanics” of Heisenberg and the “wave mechanics” of Schr¨odinger which gave rise to the contemporary form of quantum theory, originated from ingenious attempts to t mathemat- ical objects able to reect some unusual (from the macroscopic point of view) features of microparticle behavior – in particular, a peculiar combination of continuous and discrete properties. The “probabilistic interpretation” developed later by Born and others elucidated the mean- ing of operator formalism by postulating rules connecting mathematical objects with observable quantities. However a good deal of arbitrari- ness remained in these postulates and the most convincing argument for quantum-theoretical explanations was still the “striking” coincidence of theoretical predictions with experimental data. This state of affairs gave rise to numerous attempts, on one hand, to nd classical alternatives to quantum theory which would give an equally satisfactory description of the experimental data, and on the other hand, to nd out physical and philosophical arguments for justifying the inevitability of the new me- chanics. Notwithstanding the impressive philosophical achievements in this eld there was and still is a need for the structural investigation of quan- tum theory from a more mathematical point of view aimed at elucidating the connections between the entities of the physical world and the ele- ments of operator formalism. The present book is essentially in this line of research opened by the classical von Neumann's treatise “Mathemati- cal Foundations of Quantum Mechanics”. However it differs from most subsequent investigations by the strong emphasis on the statistical rather than “logical” essence of quantum theory; it gives an account of recentxiv Alexander Holevo progress in the statistical theory of quantum measurement, stimulated by the new applications of quantum mechanics, particularly in quantum op- tics. The rst three chapters give an introduction to the foundations of quan- tum mechanics, addressed to the reader interested in the structure of quantum theory and its relations with classical probability. In spite of the mathematical character of the presentation it is not “axiomatic”. Its purpose is to display the origin of the basic elements of operator formal- ism resting, as far as possible, upon the classical probabilistic concepts. The present revision is not an end in itself – it emerged from the so- lution of concrete problems concerning the quantum limitations to mea- surement accuracy, arising in applications. So far there has been no gen- eral approach to such kind of problems. The methods of mathemati- cal statistics adapted for classical measurements required radial quantum modication. The last chapters of the book are devoted to the recently developed quantum estimation theory, which is an analog of the corre- sponding branch of mathematical statistics. We now give a more detailed account of the contents of the book. In Chapter 1 the general concepts of state and measurement are introduced on the basis of statistical analysis of an experimental situation. From the very beginning this approach leads to a substantial generalization of the Dirac-von Neumann concept of an observable. Mathematically it is re- ected by the occurrence of arbitrary resolutions of identity in place of or- thogonal ones (spectral measures) and the repudiation of self-adjointness as an indispensable attribute of an observable. In this way nonorthog- onal resolutions of identity like the “overcomplete” system of coherent states known in physics for rather a long time nd their proper place in quantum phenomenology. The new concept of quantum measurement is central for the whole book. The notion of statistical model exploited in Chapter 1 is quite general and may nd applications different from quantum theory. It gives us a new insight into the still controversial “hidden variables” problem. In Chapter 2 the elements of operator theory in Hilbert space are intro- duced to provide mathematical background for the subsequent material. As compared to standard presentations relatively much attention is paid to nonorthogonal resolutions of identity and related questions. A novel feature is also the introduction of the L 2 spaces of observables associ- ated with a quantum state and playing a role similar to the Hilbert space of random variables with nite second moment in probability theory. These L 2 spaces give the framework for a calculus of unbounded operators. Of fundamental importance to quantum theory are groups of symme- tries. In Chapter 3 elementary quantum mechanics is considered from thisxv Probabilistic and Statistical Aspects of Quantum Theory point of view. An important result of this discussion is the isolation of the notion of covariant measurement which ties physical quantities with cer- tain classes of resolutions of identity in the underlying Hilbert space. In this way we construct quantum measurements canonically corresponding to such quantities as time, phase of harmonic oscillator, angle of rotation and joint measurement of coordinate and velocity. Allowing the broader concept of quantum measurement enables us to resolve old troubles of quantum theory connected with the non-existence of self-adjoint opera- tors having the required covariance properties. Chapter 4 is devoted to a more advanced study of covariant measure- ments and extreme quantum limits for the accuracy of estimation of phys- ical parameters. The latter problem becomes important in view of the progress in experimental physics. We present a unied statistical ap- proach to “non-standard” uncertainty relations of the “angle-angular mo- mentum” type. They appear to be related to the quantum analog of the Hunt-Stein theorem in mathematical statistics. A general conclusion which can be drawn from Chapter 4 is that the requirements of covariance and optimality, i.e., extremal quantum accuracy, determine the canoni- cal measurement of a “shift” parameter, such as angle, coordinate, time, uniquely up to a “gauge” transformation. An example of a situation where quantum limitations are important is provided by optical communication. As it is known, “quantum noise” dis- torting the signal in the optical range can be much more signicant than the thermal background radiation. As in ordinary communication theory the problem of signal estimation arises, but now it requires a specically quantum-theoretic formulation and solution. Chapter 5 is devoted to the so-called Gaussian states which, in par- ticular, describe radiation elds in optical communication theory. The presentation is intended to make maximal use of the remarkable parallel with the Gaussian probability distributions. An important role is played here by quantum characteristic functions. In Chapter 6 the general inequalities for the measurement mean square errors are derived, which are quantum analogs of the well-known Cramer- Rao inequality in mathematical statistics. The best unbiased measure- ments of the mean-value parameters of a Gaussian state are describ- ed. Needless to say, the present book cannot (and is not intended to) re- place the standard textbooks on quantum mechanics. Most of the impor- tant topics, such as perturbation theory, are apparently out of its scope. Nor does it pretend to give a full account of quantum measurements. We have discussed only those problems which concern measurement statis- tics and do not require consideration of state changes after measurements.The references to the relevant work on “open” quantum systems and quantum stochastic processes can be found in the comments. The author's intention was to write a book accessible to a wide circle of readers, both mathematicians and physicists. As a result, the presenta- tion, being in general mathematical, is rather informal and certainly not “the most economic” from a mathematical point of view. On the other hand, it neglects some subtleties concerning measurability etc. As a rule a rigorous treatment can be found in the special papers refered to. The necessary background for the whole material is knowledge of fundamen- tals of probability theory. Mathematically the most elementary is Chapter 1 which uses mainly nite-dimensional linear analysis. The functional analytic minimum is given in Section 2.1-2.6 of Chapter 2, and a math- ematically educated reader may just glance over it. On the other hand, a reader familiar with quantum mechanics can omit the detailed discussion of such topics as harmonic oscillators and spin in Chapter 3, included to make the presentation self-contained, and concentrate on less familiar things. The Dirac notation is used intensively throughout the book but with round brackets for the inner product as accepted in mathematical litera- ture. The angle brackets, associated with the averaging symbol in statis- tical mechanics, are reserved for the different inner product dening the correlation of a pair of observables. To denote a quantum state as well as its density operator we use the letter S (not the usual $\rho$ ) allied to the notation P for the classical state (probability distribution).

@article{Weingarten2016,
abstract = {Although quantum mechanics is fundamental for understanding molecular mechanisms in physics and chemistry, it has usually been assumed to be unimportant for understanding molecular mechanisms of biological systems. However, there is increasing evidence that quantum mechanics is important for understanding some biological phenomena (Lambert et al., 2013), such as energy transfer in photosynthesis (Fassioli et al., 2014), navigation by birds using the earth's magnetic field (Hiscock et al., 2016), and electron and hydrogen tunneling in biochemical reactions (Klinman and Kohen, 2013). There have also been proposals that quantum mechanics may help explain aspects of brain function. Discussions about quantum mechanics and the brain began with questions on the role of measurement or observation in quantum mechanics (Stapp, 1991; Theise and Kafatos, 2013). Further developments began to highlight the possibility that quantum mechanics might help explain neural mechanisms involved in consciousness or synaptic function (Stapp, 1991; Beck and Eccles, 1992). Another topic that emerged was whether quantum mechanisms might be employed by the brain to perform calculations, i.e., the possibility of quantum computing in the brain (Penrose, 1989). For example, a model of consciousness was developed that involves quantum computations in neuronal microtubules (Tegmark, 2000; Penrose and Hameroff, 2011; Hameroff and Penrose, 2014a,b; Reimers et al., 2014; Craddock et al., 2015). Other proposals have focused on the quantum phenomenon of spin (see below). Hu and Wu (2004) suggested that nuclear spins of hydrogen, nitrogen, and phosphorus in neuronal cellular components and electron spins of diffusible oxygen and nitric oxide in the brain might mediate consciousness. Electron spins in the brain have also been suggested as a potential target of transcranial magnetic stimulation therapies (Chervyakov et al., 2015). Other perspectives have led to application of quantum probability theory to human decision making (Wang et al., 2014; Kvam et al., 2015). Finally, the above mentioned navigation by birds may involve a quantum mechanical cryptochrome radical-pair (spin dynamic) mechanism in neuronal retinal ganglion cells that transmit information to the brain (Mouritsen et al., 2004; Hiscock et al., 2016). Recently a new model for how the brain may store and process quantum information has been proposed (Fisher, 2015). The model includes specific biochemical components that could be employed for quantum processing in glutamatergic neurotransmission. It has potential relevance for molecular mechanisms underlying normal neural function, such as glutamatergic dependent neurocognitive systems, as well as psychiatric treatments such as lithium.},

@book{Cardona2017,
abstract = {This monograph presents various ongoing approaches to the vast topic of quantization, which is the process of forming a quantum mechanical system starting from a classical one, and discusses their numerous fruitful interactions with mathematics. The opening chapter introduces the various forms of quantization and their interactions with each other and with mathematics. A first approach to quantization, called deformation quantization, consists of viewing the Planck constant as a small parameter. This approach provides a deformation of the structure of the algebra of classical observables rather than a radical change in the nature of the observables. When symmetries come into play, deformation quantization needs to be merged with group actions, which is presented in chapter 2, by Simone Gutt. The noncommutativity arising from quantization is the main concern of noncommutative geometry. Allowing for the presence of symmetries requires working with principal fiber bundles in a non-commutative setup, where Hopf algebras appear naturally. This is the topic of chapter 3, by Christian Kassel. Nichols algebras, a special type of Hopf algebras, are the subject of chapter 4, by Nicol{\'{a}}s Andruskiewitsch. The purely algebraic approaches given in the previous chapters do not take the geometry of space-time into account. For this purpose a special treatment using a more geometric point of view is required. An approach to field quantization on curved space-time, with applications to cosmology, is presented in chapter 5 in an account of the lectures of Abhay Ashtekar that brings a complementary point of view to non-commutativity. An alternative quantization procedure is known under the name of string theory. In chapter 6 its supersymmetric version is presented. Superstrings have drawn the attention of many mathematicians, due to its various fruitful interactions with algebraic geometry, some of which are described here. The remaining chapters discuss further topics, as the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism and direct products of spectral triples. This volume addresses both physicists and mathematicians and serves as an introduction to ongoing research in very active areas of mathematics and physics at the border line between geometry, topology, algebra and quantum field theory.

abstract = {String Theory comprises two volumes which give a comprehensive and pedagogic account of the subject. Volume 1, first published in 1998, provides a thorough introduction to the bosonic string. The first four chapters introduce the central ideas of string theory, the tools of conformal field theory and of the Polyakov path integral, and the covariant quantization of the string. The next three chapters treat string interactions: the general formalism, and detailed treatments of the tree level and one loop amplitudes. Chapter eight covers toroidal compactification and many important aspects of string physics, such as T-duality and D-branes. Chapter nine treats higher-order amplitudes, including an analysis of their finiteness and unitarity, and various nonperturbative ideas. An appendix giving a short course on path integral methods is included. This is an essential text and reference for graduate students and researchers interested in modern superstring theory.},

@article{Balachandran2011,
abstract = {There are several instances where quantum anomalies of continuous and discrete classical symmetries play an important role in fundamental physics. Examples come from chiral anomalies in the Standard Model of fundamental interactions and gravitational anomalies in string theories. Their generic origin is the fact that classical symmetries may not preserve the domains of quantum operators like the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show by simple examples that anomalous symmetries can often be implemented at the expense of working with mixed states having non-zero entropies. In particular there is the result on color breaking by non-abelian magnetic monopoles. This anomaly can be rectified by using impure states. We also argue that non-abelian groups of twisted bundles are always anomalous for pure states sharpening an earlier argument of Sorkin and Balachandran. This is the case of mapping class groups of geons indicating that "large" diffeos are anomalous for pure states in the presence of geons. Nevertheless diffeo invariance may be restored by using impure states. This work concludes with examples of these ideas drawn from molecular physics. The above approach using impure states is entirely equivalent to restricting all states to the algebra of observables invariant under the anomalous symmetries. For anomalous gauge groups such as color, this would mean that we work with observables singlet under global gauge transformations. For color, this will mean that we work with color singlets, a reasonable constraint.},

abstract = {The von Neumann entropy of a generic quantum state is not unique unless the state can be uniquely decomposed as a sum of extremal or pure states. As pointed out to us by Sorkin, this happens if the GNS representation (of the algebra of observables in some quantum state) is reducible, and some representations in the decomposition occur with non-trivial degeneracy. This non-unique entropy can occur at zero temperature. We will argue elsewhere in detail that the degeneracies in the GNS representation can be interpreted as an emergent broken gauge symmetry, and play an important role in the analysis of emergent entropy due to non-Abelian anomalies. Finally, we establish the analogue of an H-theorem for this entropy by showing that its evolution is Markovian, determined by a stochastic matrix.},

abstract = {Attenuation is the reduction of the intensity of an x-ray beam as it traverses matter. The reduction may be caused by absorption or by deflection (scatter) of photons from the beam and can be affected by different factors such as beam energy and atomic number of the absorber. An attenuation coefficient is a measure of the quantity of radiation attenuation by a given thickness of absorber. Linear and mass attenuation coefficients are the coefficients used most often. The equation I = Ioe-mu x expresses the exponential relationship between incident primary photons and transmitted photons for a monoenergetic beam with respect to the thickness of the absorber and thus may be used to calculate the attenuation by any thickness of material. The quality or penetrating ability of an x-ray beam is usually described by stating its half-value layer (HVL). Another parameter used to describe the penetrating ability of a beam is the homogeneity coefficient. Among other things, use of added filtration reduces the intensity of the x-ray beam, increases the HVL, decreases patient exposure, and improves image quality for a given radiation dose.},

abstract = {We consider the cluster of problems raised by the relation between the notion of time, gravitational theory, quantum theory and thermodynamics; in particular, we address the problem of relating the "timelessness" of the hypothetical fundamental general covariant quantum field theory with the "evidence" of the flow of time. By using the algebraic formulation of quantum theory, we propose a unifying perspective on these problems, based on the hypothesis that in a generally covariant quantum theory the physical time-flow is not a universal property of the mechanical theory, but rather it is determined by the thermodynamical state of the system ("thermal time hypothesis"). We implement this hypothesis by using a key structural property of von Neumann algebras: the Tomita-Takesaki theorem, which allows to derive a time-flow, namely a one-parameter group of automorphisms of the observable algebra, from a generic thermal physical state. We study this time-flow, its classical limit, and we relate it to various characteristic theoretical facts, as the Unruh temperature and the Hawking radiation. We also point out the existence of a state-independent notion of "time", given by the canonical one-parameter subgroup of outer automorphisms provided by the Cocycle Radon-Nikodym theorem.},

Общие уравнения системы и метод их анализа Теоретическое исследование задач динамики систем в целом ряде слу­ чаев приводится к интегрированию обыкновенных стохастических диффе­ ренциальных уравнений, включающих безынерционные многомерные не­ линейные элементы мультипликативного и более сложных типов. К таким задачам относятся, например, исследование точности многоканальных авто­ матических систем при учете перекрестной связи каналов, исследование динамики некоторых нелинейных экстремальных самонастраивающихся систем, находящихся под действием случайных возмущений, исследование случайных колебаний упругих систем при учете нелинейных факторов (восстанавливающей силы, демпфирования и инерционности), а также целый ряд других задач. В достаточно общей форме уравнения, характери­ зующие поведение этих систем, могут быть представлены в виде Xi = фг({\#}1, . . . , Хп) + Zi (* = 1, . . . , ft), (1) где фг — однозначные нелинейные функции своих аргументов, Zi(t) — воз­ мущения, являющиеся случайными функциями времени. Для определения основных вероятностных моментов переменных, ха­ рактеризующих поведение упомянутых систем, возможно применение ме­ тода статистической линеаризации [1, 2], распространенного на много­ мерные безынерционные нелинейности *.

I summarize here this point of view, explaining why I think that in a fundamental description of nature we must "forget time", and how this can be done in the classical and in the quantum theory. The idea is to develop a formalism that treats dependent and independent variables on the same footing. In short, I propose to interpret mechanics as a theory of relations between variables, rather than the theory of the evolution of variables in time.},

@article{Summers2006,
abstract = {The mathematics of classical probability theory was subsumed into classical measure theory by Kolmogorov in 1933. Quantum theory as nonclassical probability theory was incorporated into the beginnings of noncommutative measure theory by von Neumann in the early 1930s, as well. To precisely this end, von Neumann initiated the study of what are now called von Neumann algebras and, with Murray, made a first classification of such algebras into three types. The nonrelativistic quantum theory of systems with finitely many degrees of freedom deals exclusively with type I algebras. However, for the description of further quantum systems, the other types of von Neumann algebras are indispensable. The paper reviews quantum probability theory in terms of general von Neumann algebras, stressing the similarity of the conceptual structure of classical and noncommutative probability theories and emphasizing the correspondence between the classical and quantum concepts, though also indicating the nonclassical nature of quantum probabilistic predictions. In addition, differences between the probability theories in the type I, II and III settings are explained. A brief description is given of quantum systems for which probability theory based on type I algebras is known to be insufficient. These illustrate the physical significance of the previously mentioned differences. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Balachandran2016,
abstract = {In nonrelatistic quantum mechanics, Born's principle of localistion is as follows: For a single particle, if a wave function {\$}\backslashpsi{\_}K{\$} vanishes outside a spatial region {\$}K{\$}, it is said to be localised in {\$}K{\$}. In particular if a spatial region {\$}K'{\$} is disjoint from {\$}K{\$}, a wave function {\$}\backslashpsi{\_}{\{}K'{\}}{\$} localised in {\$}K'{\$} is orthogonal to {\$}\backslashpsi{\_}K{\$}. Such a principle of localisation does not exist compatibly with relativity and causality in quantum field theory (Newton and Wigner) or interacting point particles (Currie,Jordan and Sudarshan).It is replaced by symplectic localisation of observables as shown by Brunetti, Guido and Longo, Schroer and others. This localisation gives a simple derivation of the spin-statistics theorem and the Unruh effect, and shows how to construct quantum fields for anyons and for massless particles with `continuous' spin. This review outlines the basic principles underlying symplectic localisation and shows or mentions its deep implications. In particular, it has the potential to affect relativistic quantum information theory and black hole physics.},

abstract = {For any Lie groupoid {\$}G{\$}, the vector bundle {\$}g{\^{}}*{\$} dual to the associated Lie algebroid {\$}g{\$} is canonically a Poisson manifold. The (reduced) C*-algebra of {\$}G{\$} (as defined by A. Connes) is shown to be a strict quantization (in the sense of M. Rieffel) of {\$}g{\^{}}*{\$}. This is proved using a generalization of Weyl's quantization prescription on flat space. Many other known strict quantizations are a special case of this procedure; on a Riemannian manifold, one recovers Connes' tangent groupoid as well as a recent generalization of Weyl's prescription. When {\$}G{\$} is the gauge groupoid of a principal bundle one is led to the Weyl quantization of a particle moving in an external Yang-Mills field. In case that {\$}G{\$} is a Lie group (with Lie algebra {\$}g{\$}) one recovers Rieffel's quantization of the Lie-Poisson structure on {\$}g{\^{}}*{\$}. A transformation group C*-algebra defined by a smooth action of a Lie group on a manifold {\$}Q{\$} turns out to be the quantization of the semidirect product Poisson manifold {\$}g{\^{}}*x Q{\$} defined by this action.},

abstract = {Differential geometry and topology have become essential tools for many theoretical physicists. In particular, they are indispensable in theoretical studies of condensed matter physics, gravity, and particle physics. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition introduces the ideas and techniques of differential geometry and topology at a level suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in these fields. The second edition of this popular and established text incorporates a number of changes designed to meet the needs of the reader and reflect the development of the subject. The book features a considerably expanded first chapter, reviewing aspects of path integral quantization and gauge theories. Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition is an ideal introduction to differential geometry and topology for postgraduate students and researchers in theoretical and mathematical physics.},

This book introduces the main ideas of quantum mechanics in language familiar to mathematicians. Readers with little prior exposure to physics will enjoy the book's conversational tone as they delve into such topics as the Hilbert space approach to quantum theory; the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation in one space dimension; the Spectral Theorem for bounded and unbounded self-adjoint operators; the Stone–von Neumann Theorem; the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation; the role of Lie groups and Lie algebras in quantum mechanics; and the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics. The numerous exercises at the end of each chapter make the book suitable for both graduate courses and independent study. Most of the text is accessible to graduate students in mathematics who have had a first course in real analysis, covering the basics of L2 spaces and Hilbert spaces. The final chapters introduce readers who are familiar with the theory of manifolds to more advanced topics, including geometric quantization.},

abstract = {Simulating quantum mechanics is known to be a difficult computational problem, especially when dealing with large systems. However, this difficulty may be overcome by using some controllable quantum system to study another less controllable or accessible quantum system, i.e., quantum simulation. Quantum simulation promises to have applications in the study of many problems in, e.g., condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry and cosmology. Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to con- struct. A number of quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins and photons have been proposed as quan- tum simulators. This review outlines the main theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum simulation and emphasizes some of the challenges and promises of this fast-growing field. APS/123-QED PACS},

The capability of controlling our channel allows us to visualize its effects in a quantum system. Differently from standard dephasing channels, our channel presents an exotic behavior in the sense that the evolution of a state, from a pure to a mixed state, shows an oscillatory behavior if tracked in the Bloch sphere.

In particular, we find that efficiency is sensitive to symmetric and asymmetric superposition of states in the basis of localized excitations, indicating that initial-state properties can be used as an efficiency control parameter at low temperatures.},

This introduction is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of the field, as the subject of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) physics is large and complex. Rather, it is intended to lay a conceptual foundation by which magnetic resonance image formation can be understood from an intuitive perspective. The presentation is nonmathematical, relying on simple models that take the reader progressively from the basic spin physics of nuclei, through descriptions of how the magnetic resonance signal is generated and detected in an MRI scanner, the foundations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation, and a discussion of the Fourier transform and its relation to MR image formation. The article continues with a discussion of how magnetic field gradients are used to facilitate spatial encoding and concludes with a development of basic pulse sequences and the factors defining image contrast.},

@article{Zurek2003,
abstract = {The manner in which states of some quantum systems become effectively classical is of great significance for the foundations of quantum physics, as well as for problems of practical interest such as quantum engineering. In the past two decades it has become increasingly clear that many (perhaps all) of the symptoms of classicality can be induced in quantum systems by their environments. Thus decoherence is caused by the interaction in which the environment in effect monitors certain observables of the system, destroying coherence between the pointer states corresponding to their eigenvalues. This leads to environment-induced superselection or einselection, a quantum process associated with selective loss of information. Einselected pointer states are stable. They can retain correlations with the rest of the universe in spite of the environment. Einselection enforces classicality by imposing an effective ban on the vast majority of the Hilbert space, eliminating especially the flagrantly nonlocal “Schr{\"{o}}dinger-cat states.” The classical structure of phase space emerges from the quantum Hilbert space in the appropriate macroscopic limit. Combination of einselection with dynamics leads to the idealizations of a point and of a classical trajectory. In measurements, einselection replaces quantum entanglement between the apparatus and the measured system with the classical correlation. Only the preferred pointer observable of the apparatus can store information that has predictive power. When the measured quantum system is microscopic and isolated, this restriction on the predictive utility of its correlations with the macroscopic apparatus results in the effective “collapse of the wave packet.” The existential interpretation implied by einselection regards observers as open quantum systems, distinguished only by their ability to acquire, store, and process information. Spreading of the correlations with the effectively classical pointer states throughout the environment allows one to understand “classical reality” as a property based on the relatively objective existence of the einselected states. Effectively classical pointer states can be “found out” without being re-prepared, e.g, by intercepting the information already present in the environment. The redundancy of the records of pointer states in the environment (which can be thought of as their “fitness” in the Darwinian sense) is a measure of their classicality. A new symmetry appears in this setting. Environment-assisted invariance or envariance sheds new light on the nature of ignorance of the state of the system due to quantum correlations with the environment and leads to Born's rules and to reduced density matrices, ultimately justifying basic principles of the program of decoherence and einselection.},

Additionally, we employ the interference pattern as a function of the separation between the beams to determine the spatial coherence length of the original beam.},

abstract = {Attenuation is the reduction of the intensity of an x-ray beam as it traverses matter. The reduction may be caused by absorption or by deflection (scatter) of photons from the beam and can be affected by different factors such as beam energy and atomic number of the absorber. An attenuation coefficient is a measure of the quantity of radiation attenuation by a given thickness of absorber. Linear and mass attenuation coefficients are the coefficients used most often. The equation I = Ioe-mu x expresses the exponential relationship between incident primary photons and transmitted photons for a monoenergetic beam with respect to the thickness of the absorber and thus may be used to calculate the attenuation by any thickness of material. The quality or penetrating ability of an x-ray beam is usually described by stating its half-value layer (HVL). Another parameter used to describe the penetrating ability of a beam is the homogeneity coefficient. Among other things, use of added filtration reduces the intensity of the x-ray beam, increases the HVL, decreases patient exposure, and improves image quality for a given radiation dose.},

Una muestra cristalina s{\'{o}}lida o en polvo en polvo C, se monta sobre una mesa H, que puede girar alrededor de un eje O perpendicular al plano del dibujo. La fuente de rayos X es S y el blanco del tubo de rayos X es T. Los rayos X divergen desde la fuente y son difractados por la muestra para formar un haz difractado convergente que focaliza en la rendija F y luego ingresa al contador G. A y B son rendijas especiales que definen y coliman a los haces incidente y difractado. La rendija receptora F y el contador se soportan en un carril E que puede girar alrededor del eje O y cuya posici{\'{o}}n angular 2[ puede ser le{\'{i}}da sobre la escala graduada K. Los soportes E y H est{\'{a}}n acoplados mec{\'{a}}nicamente de tal forma que una rotaci{\'{o}}n del contador a trav{\'{e}}s de 2x grados es acompa{\~{n}}ada por la rotaci{\'{o}}n de la muestra a trav{\'{e}}s de x grados. Un motor produce el movimiento del contador a velocidad angular constante. 1.2. {\'{O}}PTICA DE LOS RAYOS X El funcionamiento de un difract{\'{o}}metro de rayos X, se basa en el Principio de focalizaci{\'{o}}n de BRAGG-BRENTANO. Este principio establece que para cualquier posici{\'{o}}n del sistema de detecci{\'{o}}n de rayos X, el diafragma receptor F del sistema de detecci{\'{o}}n y el diafragma de entrada S (o el foco del tubo de rayos X), est{\'{a}}n siempre localizados sobre un c{\'{i}}rculo denominado c{\'{i}}rculo difractom{\'{e}}trico.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This offers a solution to the central open question raised in [Groisman, PRA 72, 032317 (2005)] and complements their main result that the minimal rate of noise needed to erase all correlations is given by the quantum mutual information. We extend our discussion to the tripartite setting where we show that an asymptotic rate of noise given by the regularized relative entropy of recovery is sufficient to catalytically transform the state to a locally recoverable version of the state.},

We show how to use the same protection from noise to implement universal fermionic quantum computation. Our architecture requires only two Majoranas to encode a fermionic quantum degree of freedom, compared to alternative implementations which require a minimum of four Majoranas for a spin quantum degree of freedom. The fermionic degrees of freedom support both unitary coupled cluster variational quantum eigensolver and quantum phase estimation algorithms, proposed for quantum chemistry simulations. Because we avoid the Jordan-Wigner transformation, our scheme has a lower overhead for implementing both of these algorithms, and the simulation of Trotterized Hubbard Hamiltonian in {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(1){\$} time per unitary step. We finally demonstrate magic state distillation in our fermionic architecture, giving a universal set of topologically protected fermionic quantum gates.},

These are in general different. Therefore one reaches the remarkable possibility that there may be many entropies for a given state [Private communication from R. Sorkin]. This ambiguity in entropy can often be traced to a gauge symmetry emergent from the non-trivial topological character of the configuration space of the underlying system. It can also happen in finite-dimensional matrix models. In the present work, we discuss this entropy ambiguity and its consequences for an ethylene molecule. This is a very simple and well-known system where these notions can be put to tests. Besides its intrinsic conceptual interest, the simplicity of this model can serve as an introduction to a similar discussion of systems such as coloured monopoles and the breaking of colour symmetry.},

abstract = {Non-local observables play an important role in quantum theory, from Bell inequalities and various post-selection paradoxes to quantum error correction codes. Instantaneous measurement of these observables is known to be a difficult problem, especially when the measurements are projective. The standard von Neumann Hamiltonian used to model projective measurements cannot be implemented directly in a non-local scenario and can, in some cases, violate causality. We present a scheme for effectively generating the von Neumann Hamiltonian for non-local observables without the need to communicate and adapt. The protocol can be used to perform weak and strong (projective) measurements, as well as measurements at any intermediate strength. It can also be used in practical situations beyond non-local measurements. We show how the protocol can be used to probe a version of Hardy's paradox with both weak and strong measurements. The outcomes of these measurements provide a non-intuitive picture of the pre- and post-selected system. Our results shed new light on the interplay between quantum measurements, uncertainty, non-locality, causality and determinism.},

abstract = {We present a general approach to quantum entanglement and entropy that is based on algebras of observables and states thereon. In contrast to more standard treatments, Hilbert space is an emergent concept, appearing as a representation space of the observable algebra, once a state is chosen. In this approach, which is based on the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal construction, the study of subsystems becomes particularly clear. We explicitly show how the problems associated with the partial trace for the study of entanglement of identical particles are readily overcome. In particular, a suitable entanglement measure is proposed that can be applied to systems of particles obeying Fermi, Bose, para-, and even braid-group statistics. The generality of the method is also illustrated by study of the time evolution of subsystems emerging from restriction to subalgebras. Problems related to anomalies and quantum epistemology are also discussed. DOI:},

abstract = {It has been known for some years that entanglement entropy obtained from partial trace does not provide the correct entanglement measure when applied to systems of identical particles. Several criteria have been proposed that have the drawback of being different according to whether one is dealing with fermions, bosons, or distinguishable particles. In this Letter, we give a precise and mathematically natural answer to this problem. Our approach is based on the use of the more general idea of the restriction of states to subalgebras. It leads to a novel approach to entanglement, which is suitable to be used in general quantum systems and especially in systems of identical particles. This settles some recent controversy regarding entanglement for identical particles. The prospects for applications of our criteria are wide ranging, from spin chains in condensed matter to entropy of black holes.},

Recently, and largely motivated by the need of an experimentally realistic definition for quantum computing applications, the quantum geometric phase was generalized to open systems. The definition takes a kinematical approach, with an initial state that is evolved cyclically but coupled to an environment--leading to a correction of the geometric phase with respect to the uncoupled case. We obtain this correction by measuring the nonunitary evolution of the reduced density matrix of a spin one-half coupled to an environment. In particular we are interested in baths near a quantum phase transition, which are known to induce strong decoherence. The experiments are done with a NMR quantum simulator, where we emulate qualitatively the influence of a critical environment using a simple one-qubit model.},

While the answer is affirmative in the qualitative sense, the situation is less clear if monogamy is intended as a quantitative limitation on the distribution of bipartite entanglement in a multipartite system, given some particular measure of entanglement. Here, we formalize what it takes for a bipartite measure of entanglement to obey a general quantitative monogamy relation on all quantum states. We then prove that an important class of entanglement measures fail to be monogamous in this general sense of the term, with monogamy violations becoming generic with increasing dimension. In particular, we show that every additive and suitably normalized entanglement measure cannot satisfy any nontrivial general monogamy relation while at the same time faithfully capturing the geometric entanglement structure of the fully antisymmetric state in arbitrary dimension. Nevertheless, monogamy of such entanglement measures can be recovered if one allows for dimension-dependent relations, as we show explicitly with relevant examples.},

Secondly, in the quantum logic formalism, I emphasize which axioms for the lattice of propositions (existence of an orthocomplementation and the covering property) derive from reversibility. A new argument based on locality and Soler's theorem is used to derive the representation as projectors on a regular Hilbert space from the general quantum logic formalism.

abstract = {The concept of stochastic matrix product states is introduced and a natural form for the states is derived. This allows to define the analogue of Schmidt coefficients for steady states of non-equilibrium stochastic processes. We discuss a new measure for correlations which is analogous to the entanglement entropy, the entropy cost {\$}S{\_}C{\$}, and show that this measure quantifies the bond dimension needed to represent a steady state as a matrix product state. We illustrate these concepts on the hand of the asymmetric exclusion process.},
