This mathematically rigorous method provides a hint at the correct definition of (total) angular momentum operators, for arbitrary spin, in a system of indistinguishable particles. The connection with other configuration space approaches to spin-statistics is discussed, as well as the relevance of the obtained results in view of a possible alternative proof of the spin-statistics theorem.},

abstract = {The von Neumann entropy of a generic quantum state is not unique unless the state can be uniquely decomposed as a sum of extremal or pure states. As pointed out to us by Sorkin, this happens if the GNS representation (of the algebra of observables in some quantum state) is reducible, and some representations in the decomposition occur with non-trivial degeneracy. This non-unique entropy can occur at zero temperature. We will argue elsewhere in detail that the degeneracies in the GNS representation can be interpreted as an emergent broken gauge symmetry, and play an important role in the analysis of emergent entropy due to non-Abelian anomalies. Finally, we establish the analogue of an H-theorem for this entropy by showing that its evolution is Markovian, determined by a stochastic matrix.},

abstract = {Using the method of canonical group quantization, we construct the angular momentum operators associated to configuration spaces with the topology of (i) a sphere and (ii) a projective plane. In the first case, the obtained angular momentum operators are the quantum version of Poincare's vector, i.e., the physically correct angular momentum operators for an electron coupled to the field of a magnetic monopole. In the second case, the obtained operators represent the angular momentum operators of a system of two indistinguishable spin zero quantum particles in three spatial dimensions. We explicitly show how our formalism relates to the one developed by Berry and Robbins. The relevance of the proposed formalism for an advance in our understanding of the spin-statistics connection in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is discussed.},

@article{Balachandran2013a,
abstract = {In a quantum system, there may be many density matrices associated with a state on an algebra of observables. For each density matrix, one can compute its entropy. These are in general different. Therefore one reaches the remarkable possibility that there may be many entropies for a given state [Private communication from R. Sorkin]. This ambiguity in entropy can often be traced to a gauge symmetry emergent from the non-trivial topological character of the configuration space of the underlying system. It can also happen in finite-dimensional matrix models. In the present work, we discuss this entropy ambiguity and its consequences for an ethylene molecule. This is a very simple and well-known system where these notions can be put to tests. Besides its intrinsic conceptual interest, the simplicity of this model can serve as an introduction to a similar discussion of systems such as coloured monopoles and the breaking of colour symmetry.},

abstract = {Differential geometry and topology have become essential tools for many theoretical physicists. In particular, they are indispensable in theoretical studies of condensed matter physics, gravity, and particle physics. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition introduces the ideas and techniques of differential geometry and topology at a level suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in these fields. The second edition of this popular and established text incorporates a number of changes designed to meet the needs of the reader and reflect the development of the subject. The book features a considerably expanded first chapter, reviewing aspects of path integral quantization and gauge theories. Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition is an ideal introduction to differential geometry and topology for postgraduate students and researchers in theoretical and mathematical physics.},

@article{Summers2006,
abstract = {The mathematics of classical probability theory was subsumed into classical measure theory by Kolmogorov in 1933. Quantum theory as nonclassical probability theory was incorporated into the beginnings of noncommutative measure theory by von Neumann in the early 1930s, as well. To precisely this end, von Neumann initiated the study of what are now called von Neumann algebras and, with Murray, made a first classification of such algebras into three types. The nonrelativistic quantum theory of systems with finitely many degrees of freedom deals exclusively with type I algebras. However, for the description of further quantum systems, the other types of von Neumann algebras are indispensable. The paper reviews quantum probability theory in terms of general von Neumann algebras, stressing the similarity of the conceptual structure of classical and noncommutative probability theories and emphasizing the correspondence between the classical and quantum concepts, though also indicating the nonclassical nature of quantum probabilistic predictions. In addition, differences between the probability theories in the type I, II and III settings are explained. A brief description is given of quantum systems for which probability theory based on type I algebras is known to be insufficient. These illustrate the physical significance of the previously mentioned differences. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The von Neumann entropy of a generic quantum state is not unique unless the state can be uniquely decomposed as a sum of extremal or pure states. As pointed out to us by Sorkin, this happens if the GNS representation (of the algebra of observables in some quantum state) is reducible, and some representations in the decomposition occur with non-trivial degeneracy. This non-unique entropy can occur at zero temperature. We will argue elsewhere in detail that the degeneracies in the GNS representation can be interpreted as an emergent broken gauge symmetry, and play an important role in the analysis of emergent entropy due to non-Abelian anomalies. Finally, we establish the analogue of an H-theorem for this entropy by showing that its evolution is Markovian, determined by a stochastic matrix.},

@article{Weingarten2016,
abstract = {Although quantum mechanics is fundamental for understanding molecular mechanisms in physics and chemistry, it has usually been assumed to be unimportant for understanding molecular mechanisms of biological systems. However, there is increasing evidence that quantum mechanics is important for understanding some biological phenomena (Lambert et al., 2013), such as energy transfer in photosynthesis (Fassioli et al., 2014), navigation by birds using the earth's magnetic field (Hiscock et al., 2016), and electron and hydrogen tunneling in biochemical reactions (Klinman and Kohen, 2013). There have also been proposals that quantum mechanics may help explain aspects of brain function. Discussions about quantum mechanics and the brain began with questions on the role of measurement or observation in quantum mechanics (Stapp, 1991; Theise and Kafatos, 2013). Further developments began to highlight the possibility that quantum mechanics might help explain neural mechanisms involved in consciousness or synaptic function (Stapp, 1991; Beck and Eccles, 1992). Another topic that emerged was whether quantum mechanisms might be employed by the brain to perform calculations, i.e., the possibility of quantum computing in the brain (Penrose, 1989). For example, a model of consciousness was developed that involves quantum computations in neuronal microtubules (Tegmark, 2000; Penrose and Hameroff, 2011; Hameroff and Penrose, 2014a,b; Reimers et al., 2014; Craddock et al., 2015). Other proposals have focused on the quantum phenomenon of spin (see below). Hu and Wu (2004) suggested that nuclear spins of hydrogen, nitrogen, and phosphorus in neuronal cellular components and electron spins of diffusible oxygen and nitric oxide in the brain might mediate consciousness. Electron spins in the brain have also been suggested as a potential target of transcranial magnetic stimulation therapies (Chervyakov et al., 2015). Other perspectives have led to application of quantum probability theory to human decision making (Wang et al., 2014; Kvam et al., 2015). Finally, the above mentioned navigation by birds may involve a quantum mechanical cryptochrome radical-pair (spin dynamic) mechanism in neuronal retinal ganglion cells that transmit information to the brain (Mouritsen et al., 2004; Hiscock et al., 2016). Recently a new model for how the brain may store and process quantum information has been proposed (Fisher, 2015). The model includes specific biochemical components that could be employed for quantum processing in glutamatergic neurotransmission. It has potential relevance for molecular mechanisms underlying normal neural function, such as glutamatergic dependent neurocognitive systems, as well as psychiatric treatments such as lithium.},

abstract = {These lectures are intended as an introduction to the technique of path integrals and their applications in physics. The audience is mainly first-year graduate students, and it is assumed that the reader has a good foundation in quantum mechanics. No prior exposure to path integrals is assumed, however. The path integral is a formulation of quantum mechanics equivalent to the standard formulations, offering a new way of looking at the subject which is, arguably, more intuitive than the usual approaches. Applications of path integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. After an introduction including a very brief historical overview of the subject, we derive a path integral expression for the propagator in quantum mechanics, including the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. We then discuss a variety of applications, including path integrals in multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics, perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and instantons via path integrals. For the most part, the emphasis is on explicit calculations in the familiar setting of quantum mechanics, with some discussion (often brief and schematic) of how these ideas can be applied to more complicated situations such as field theory.},

abstract = {Quantum indistinguishability plays a crucial role in many low-energy physical phenomena, from quantum fluids to molecular spectroscopy. It is, however, typically ignored in most high temperature processes, particularly for ionic coordinates, implicitly assumed to be distinguishable, incoherent and thus well-approximated classically. We explore chemical reactions involving small symmetric molecules, and argue that in many situations a full quantum treatment of collective nuclear degrees of freedom is essential. Supported by several physical arguments, we conjecture a "Quantum Dynamical Selection" (QDS) rule for small symmetric molecules that precludes chemical processes that involve direct transitions from orbitally non-symmetric molecular states. As we propose and discuss, the implications of the Quantum Dynamical Selection rule include: (i) a differential chemical reactivity of para- and ortho-hydrogen, (ii) a mechanism for inducing inter-molecular quantum entanglement of nuclear spins, (iii) a new isotope fractionation mechanism, (iv) a novel explanation of the enhanced chemical activity of "Reactive Oxygen Species", (v) illuminating the importance of ortho-water molecules in modulating the quantum dynamics of liquid water, (vi) providing the critical quantum-to-biochemical linkage in the nuclear spin model of the (putative) quantum brain, among others.},

The quantum network can be trained efficiently using gradient descent on a cost function to perform quantum generalisations of classical tasks.

@book{Holevo2011,
abstract = {The mathematical language of modern quantum mechanics is operator theory. Operators play there a role similar to functions in classical me- chanics, probability theory and statistics. However, while the use of func- tions in classical theories is founded on premises which seem intuitively quite clear, in quantum theory the situation with operators is different. Historically the “matrix mechanics” of Heisenberg and the “wave mechanics” of Schr¨odinger which gave rise to the contemporary form of quantum theory, originated from ingenious attempts to t mathemat- ical objects able to reect some unusual (from the macroscopic point of view) features of microparticle behavior – in particular, a peculiar combination of continuous and discrete properties. The “probabilistic interpretation” developed later by Born and others elucidated the mean- ing of operator formalism by postulating rules connecting mathematical objects with observable quantities. However a good deal of arbitrari- ness remained in these postulates and the most convincing argument for quantum-theoretical explanations was still the “striking” coincidence of theoretical predictions with experimental data. This state of affairs gave rise to numerous attempts, on one hand, to nd classical alternatives to quantum theory which would give an equally satisfactory description of the experimental data, and on the other hand, to nd out physical and philosophical arguments for justifying the inevitability of the new me- chanics. Notwithstanding the impressive philosophical achievements in this eld there was and still is a need for the structural investigation of quan- tum theory from a more mathematical point of view aimed at elucidating the connections between the entities of the physical world and the ele- ments of operator formalism. The present book is essentially in this line of research opened by the classical von Neumann's treatise “Mathemati- cal Foundations of Quantum Mechanics”. However it differs from most subsequent investigations by the strong emphasis on the statistical rather than “logical” essence of quantum theory; it gives an account of recentxiv Alexander Holevo progress in the statistical theory of quantum measurement, stimulated by the new applications of quantum mechanics, particularly in quantum op- tics. The rst three chapters give an introduction to the foundations of quan- tum mechanics, addressed to the reader interested in the structure of quantum theory and its relations with classical probability. In spite of the mathematical character of the presentation it is not “axiomatic”. Its purpose is to display the origin of the basic elements of operator formal- ism resting, as far as possible, upon the classical probabilistic concepts. The present revision is not an end in itself – it emerged from the so- lution of concrete problems concerning the quantum limitations to mea- surement accuracy, arising in applications. So far there has been no gen- eral approach to such kind of problems. The methods of mathemati- cal statistics adapted for classical measurements required radial quantum modication. The last chapters of the book are devoted to the recently developed quantum estimation theory, which is an analog of the corre- sponding branch of mathematical statistics. We now give a more detailed account of the contents of the book. In Chapter 1 the general concepts of state and measurement are introduced on the basis of statistical analysis of an experimental situation. From the very beginning this approach leads to a substantial generalization of the Dirac-von Neumann concept of an observable. Mathematically it is re- ected by the occurrence of arbitrary resolutions of identity in place of or- thogonal ones (spectral measures) and the repudiation of self-adjointness as an indispensable attribute of an observable. In this way nonorthog- onal resolutions of identity like the “overcomplete” system of coherent states known in physics for rather a long time nd their proper place in quantum phenomenology. The new concept of quantum measurement is central for the whole book. The notion of statistical model exploited in Chapter 1 is quite general and may nd applications different from quantum theory. It gives us a new insight into the still controversial “hidden variables” problem. In Chapter 2 the elements of operator theory in Hilbert space are intro- duced to provide mathematical background for the subsequent material. As compared to standard presentations relatively much attention is paid to nonorthogonal resolutions of identity and related questions. A novel feature is also the introduction of the L 2 spaces of observables associ- ated with a quantum state and playing a role similar to the Hilbert space of random variables with nite second moment in probability theory. These L 2 spaces give the framework for a calculus of unbounded operators. Of fundamental importance to quantum theory are groups of symme- tries. In Chapter 3 elementary quantum mechanics is considered from thisxv Probabilistic and Statistical Aspects of Quantum Theory point of view. An important result of this discussion is the isolation of the notion of covariant measurement which ties physical quantities with cer- tain classes of resolutions of identity in the underlying Hilbert space. In this way we construct quantum measurements canonically corresponding to such quantities as time, phase of harmonic oscillator, angle of rotation and joint measurement of coordinate and velocity. Allowing the broader concept of quantum measurement enables us to resolve old troubles of quantum theory connected with the non-existence of self-adjoint opera- tors having the required covariance properties. Chapter 4 is devoted to a more advanced study of covariant measure- ments and extreme quantum limits for the accuracy of estimation of phys- ical parameters. The latter problem becomes important in view of the progress in experimental physics. We present a unied statistical ap- proach to “non-standard” uncertainty relations of the “angle-angular mo- mentum” type. They appear to be related to the quantum analog of the Hunt-Stein theorem in mathematical statistics. A general conclusion which can be drawn from Chapter 4 is that the requirements of covariance and optimality, i.e., extremal quantum accuracy, determine the canoni- cal measurement of a “shift” parameter, such as angle, coordinate, time, uniquely up to a “gauge” transformation. An example of a situation where quantum limitations are important is provided by optical communication. As it is known, “quantum noise” dis- torting the signal in the optical range can be much more signicant than the thermal background radiation. As in ordinary communication theory the problem of signal estimation arises, but now it requires a specically quantum-theoretic formulation and solution. Chapter 5 is devoted to the so-called Gaussian states which, in par- ticular, describe radiation elds in optical communication theory. The presentation is intended to make maximal use of the remarkable parallel with the Gaussian probability distributions. An important role is played here by quantum characteristic functions. In Chapter 6 the general inequalities for the measurement mean square errors are derived, which are quantum analogs of the well-known Cramer- Rao inequality in mathematical statistics. The best unbiased measure- ments of the mean-value parameters of a Gaussian state are describ- ed. Needless to say, the present book cannot (and is not intended to) re- place the standard textbooks on quantum mechanics. Most of the impor- tant topics, such as perturbation theory, are apparently out of its scope. Nor does it pretend to give a full account of quantum measurements. We have discussed only those problems which concern measurement statis- tics and do not require consideration of state changes after measurements.The references to the relevant work on “open” quantum systems and quantum stochastic processes can be found in the comments. The author's intention was to write a book accessible to a wide circle of readers, both mathematicians and physicists. As a result, the presenta- tion, being in general mathematical, is rather informal and certainly not “the most economic” from a mathematical point of view. On the other hand, it neglects some subtleties concerning measurability etc. As a rule a rigorous treatment can be found in the special papers refered to. The necessary background for the whole material is knowledge of fundamen- tals of probability theory. Mathematically the most elementary is Chapter 1 which uses mainly nite-dimensional linear analysis. The functional analytic minimum is given in Section 2.1-2.6 of Chapter 2, and a math- ematically educated reader may just glance over it. On the other hand, a reader familiar with quantum mechanics can omit the detailed discussion of such topics as harmonic oscillators and spin in Chapter 3, included to make the presentation self-contained, and concentrate on less familiar things. The Dirac notation is used intensively throughout the book but with round brackets for the inner product as accepted in mathematical litera- ture. The angle brackets, associated with the averaging symbol in statis- tical mechanics, are reserved for the different inner product dening the correlation of a pair of observables. To denote a quantum state as well as its density operator we use the letter S (not the usual $\rho$ ) allied to the notation P for the classical state (probability distribution).

The theory of operator algebras was initiated by von Neumann and Murray as a tool for studying group representations and as a framework for quantum mechanics, and has since kept in touch with its roots in physics as a framework for quantum statistical mechanics and the formalism of algebraic quantum field theory. However, in 1981, the study of operator algebras took a new turn with the introduction by Vaughan Jones of subfactor theory and remarkable connections were found with knot theory, 3-manifolds, quantum groups and integrable systems in statistical mechanics and conformal field theory. The purpose of this book, one of the first in the area, is to look at these combinatorial-algebraic developments from the perspective of operator algebras; to bring the reader to the frontline of research with the minimum of prerequisites from classical theory.},

abstract = {In a quantum system, there may be many density matrices associated with a state on an algebra of observables. For each density matrix, one can compute its entropy. These are in general different. Therefore one reaches the remarkable possibility that there may be many entropies for a given state [Private communication from R. Sorkin]. This ambiguity in entropy can often be traced to a gauge symmetry emergent from the non-trivial topological character of the configuration space of the underlying system. It can also happen in finite-dimensional matrix models. In the present work, we discuss this entropy ambiguity and its consequences for an ethylene molecule. This is a very simple and well-known system where these notions can be put to tests. Besides its intrinsic conceptual interest, the simplicity of this model can serve as an introduction to a similar discussion of systems such as coloured monopoles and the breaking of colour symmetry.},

abstract = {Abstract Inasmuch as physical theories are formalizable, set theory$\backslash$nprovides a framework for theoretical physics. Four speculations about$\backslash$nthe relevance of set theoretical modeling for physics are presented:$\backslash$nthe role of transcendental set theory (i) in chaos theory, (ii) for$\backslash$nparadoxical decompositions of solid three-dimensional objects, (iii)$\backslash$nin the theory of effective computability (Church-Turing thesis) related$\backslash$nto the possible solution of supertasks, and (iv) for weak solutions.$\backslash$nSeveral approaches to set theory and their advantages and disadvatages$\backslash$nfor physical applications are discussed: Canlorian naive (i.e., nonaxiomatic)$\backslash$nset theory, contructivism, and operationalism. In the author's opinion,$\backslash$nan attitude of suspended attention (a term borrowed from psychoanalysis)$\backslash$nseems most promising for progress. Physical and set theoretical entities$\backslash$nmust be operationalized wherever possible. At the same time, physicists$\backslash$nshould be open to bizarre or mindboggling new formalisms, which need$\backslash$nnot be operationalizable or testable at the lime of their creation,$\backslash$nbut which may successfully lead to novel fields of phenomenology$\backslash$nand technology.},

This book introduces the main ideas of quantum mechanics in language familiar to mathematicians. Readers with little prior exposure to physics will enjoy the book's conversational tone as they delve into such topics as the Hilbert space approach to quantum theory; the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation in one space dimension; the Spectral Theorem for bounded and unbounded self-adjoint operators; the Stone–von Neumann Theorem; the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation; the role of Lie groups and Lie algebras in quantum mechanics; and the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics. The numerous exercises at the end of each chapter make the book suitable for both graduate courses and independent study. Most of the text is accessible to graduate students in mathematics who have had a first course in real analysis, covering the basics of L2 spaces and Hilbert spaces. The final chapters introduce readers who are familiar with the theory of manifolds to more advanced topics, including geometric quantization.},

The central concepts that have shapedcontemporary understanding of the quantum world are clearly defined, withillustrations where helpful, and discussed at a level suitable forundergraduate and graduate students of physics, history of science, andphilosophy of physics. All articles share three main aims: (1) to provide aclear definition and understanding of the term concerned; (2) where possible,to trace the historical origins of the concept; and (3) to provide a small butoptimal selection of references to the most relevant literature, includingpertinent historical studies. Also discussed are the often contentiousphilosophical implications derived from quantum theory and its associatedexperimental findings.This compendium will be an indispensable resource for all those seekingconcise up-to-date information about the many facets of quantum physics.},
